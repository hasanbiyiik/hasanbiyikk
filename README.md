Hello, my name is Hasan Bıyık, I live in Turkey and I am 16 years old. I am very curious and very thoughtful.
Thanks to this curiosity, I have a lot of interests and software is in the top three of them. Although I don't have a lot of software career, I can use Kotlin and Flutter professionally and develop frontend web tools. In addition to these, I have amateur Python and Java experience. In addition, I have certificates in senior finance and project management.
